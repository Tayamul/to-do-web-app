The first thing you need to do to start using the app is to sign up with your email address. The app utilises Firebase's user authentication functionality to optimise this process, making it quick and straightforward. Once you've signed up, you'll have access to your own unique task list that only you can see and modify.

Next, you can start adding activities to your list. This could include anything from important work deadlines to household chores. You can add as many activities as you like, and each one will be displayed in a clear and organised list, making it easy to keep track of everything you need to do.

As you complete each task, you can mark it as completed within the app. This feature helps you stay motivated and provides a sense of accomplishment as you make progress towards your goals. If you need to remove a task from your list, you can simply delete it, and it will disappear from your list entirely.

To ensure that your data is always available to you, we have used Firestore to store unique user data in the app's database. This means that you can access your task list from any device, anywhere in the world. Whether you're using a desktop computer or a mobile device, you'll always have access to your tasks and can update them as needed.

Finally, we understand the importance of convenience in today's fast-paced world. That's why our Task Manager app is fully responsive, meaning that it adapts to any device you're using, whether it's a phone, tablet, or laptop. This feature allows you to manage your tasks on the go, making it easy to stay on top of everything you need to do, no matter where you are.


In summary, the Task Manager app is a simple, easy-to-use, and efficient tool designed to help you manage your daily tasks. With its user-friendly interface, user authentication functionality, organised task list, completed task tracker, and database storage, the app is the perfect solution for anyone who wants to stay organised and productive. Plus, with its responsive design, you can access your tasks from anywhere at any time. Give it a try and see how much more productive you can be!
